# test-lobster

Greetings!

Warning! Code is a mess! It's 4:00 am. I think I bite more than I could chew =)
There is no comment because I have no time left. I applogize for that.

You can see it in action at test-lobster.webtm.ru

Main routes:
/admin - you can manage lotteries there.
/participate - participate in a lottery.
/* - same as previous

The good news that it could be transfered to any framewrok or live without it. Or use any DB, as long as you provide a gateway for it.

So what I did and waht I tried to show you?
- REST level 2
- Cross-platform app
- Usage of code patterns( Hydrator, Singleton, Multiton, DTO, Gateway, Fabric Method ) It's all there.
- Dependency injection and inversion

...I guess that's it.

Almost all code was written, only Variables lib was copied from old project.
